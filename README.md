# Flushed Away

A 360iDev Game Jam entry built in Sprite Kit. By Jonathan Penn and Michele
Titolo.

## Backstory

You are a phenomenal inventor. While preparing to test your amazing shrinking
ray on a full size boat, your 2 year old child accidentally activated it. Both
you and the boat are now smaller than a toy. But that's not the worst part...

Your child decided to put you in the toilet and flush it. And now is throwing
more toys to watch it all go down the drain. Will you be able to last long
enough for the shrinking ray to wear off?


## Game Mechanics

- Stay alive as long as you can (timer with milliseconds indicates score)
- Health meter, bumping into objects depletes health
- Fall down the drain is instant death
- Everything is swirling around the center drain
- Uses parallaxed swirls to indicate water motion
- Toys appear at random around the edges and swirl toward the center
- As time increases, toys appear at a much higher frequency
- Toys can bump into each other and respond with somewhat elastic collisions
